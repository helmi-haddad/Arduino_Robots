Today, Robotics is one of the best technologies which deals with design, working and applications of Robots, computer systems for their control and information processing.
This technology also deals with automated machines and is very useful in manufacturing process.
As a result, many people show lot of interest on this technology from engineering level itself. For that reason, here i am listing out some useful and best robotics projects ideas for engineering students.
These project include some interesting concepts like line follower robot, obstacle avoiding robot, etc.
